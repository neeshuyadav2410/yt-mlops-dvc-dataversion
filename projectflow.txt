create a git repo and clone it in local
create mycopd.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
do a git add commit push before initializing dvc. 
after this # do pip install dvc
now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore , .dvc)
now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new s3 directory) # wse to s3 wgera use honge, lekin filhaal abhi kaam chalane ke liye local me hi ek directory banyenge
no we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3",, # basically telling dvc where is storage , at place of s3 it can be url of your s3 bucket
next "dvc add data/" -- we are saying to dvc that you are now responsible to tell us about any change in data under you ,
 if we directely give this commnad it will give erro, it will say you folder is already tracked by git,
  first remove it by using git rm -r --chached 'data' and git commit -r "stop tracking dta"
again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"  -- we need to do this because now dvc is tracking our data but has not saved its version in s3 --- it will save 2 files, one is csv and one will hold its ID
do a git add- commit - push to mark this as first version of data -- because change has occured in s3 and we need to push it - usually git dont' track s3 but now it is local, so it is tracking
Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
again -- dvc commit and then dvc push
then git commit push (wr're saving v2 of our data at this point)
check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date
now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data
